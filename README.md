# To-Do Compare:

## Introduction:
Just meant to learn JS frameworks and compare them while creating a similar To-Do app.
The hope is to gain a functional knowledge of working in each while also determining if I have a preference for one of the applications over the other.

## Purpose:
In addition to gaining new skillsets, I'm hoping to determine which JS framework I like to utilize it as a front-end for several test applications:

* Order Management Application: App that will simulate customer orders and package tracking. Hoping to develop a knowledge of app integration and the use of message queues.
* Beam Me Up Scotty: A Tauri app that will use the preferred JS framework to manage the frontend and Rust in the backend.
